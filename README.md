Drowsiness Detection based on the Eye Aspect Ratio. For detection first it search for the face then both eyes. If the eye aspect ratio is less than the threshold value then after 3 sec it will turn on the alarm and wake up the driver. 

**#Benefit :** Without Physical interaction of driver it can work, Even with transparent specs its working fine.

**#Limitation :** Accuracy is not good in low light condition.

Can save from road car accident by turning on the alarm.
